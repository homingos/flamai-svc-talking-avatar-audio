# MiniMax TTS and Voice Cloning API

This project provides a production-ready, asynchronous REST API for interacting with the MiniMax Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Cloning services. It is built with FastAPI for high performance and is designed for easy deployment, either as a standard server or as a serverless function on platforms like RunPod.

The architecture is modular and extensible, allowing for the easy addition of new AI services in the future.

## Features

- **High-Performance API**: Built with FastAPI and Uvicorn for asynchronous, non-blocking request handling.
- **Centralized Configuration**: All settings, including API keys, are managed in a single `config.yaml` file with environment variable support, making it secure and easy to manage different environments (dev, staging, prod).
- **Dynamic Service Loading**: The application automatically discovers and registers AI services defined in the configuration, making it highly extensible.
- **Voice Cloning**: Clone voices from an uploaded audio file.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Generate speech using pre-existing or newly cloned voices.
- **Automated Workflow**: A single endpoint (`/voice/clone-and-generate`) is provided to clone a voice and generate speech in one API call, simplifying the client-side logic.
- **Containerized & Deployable**: Comes with a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and a `runpod_app.py` handler for easy deployment on platforms like Docker or RunPod Serverless.
- **Interactive Docs**: Automatically generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) for easy testing and discovery.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or `pip` for package management.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) (for containerized deployment).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/homingos/flamai-svc-talking-avatar-audio.git
cd flamai-svc-talking-avatar-audio

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
Using uv (Recommended & Fastest):
code
Bash
# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate it (Linux/macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows PowerShell)
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install all dependencies including dev extras
uv sync --all-groups```

**Using `pip`:**

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it (Linux/macOS)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows PowerShell)
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies including the [dev] extras
pip install -e ".[dev]"

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
The API requires credentials for the MiniMax service. Create a .env file in the project root by copying the example template:
code
Bash
cp .env.example .env
Now, open the .env file and add your actual MiniMax credentials:
code
Env
# .env
MINIMAX_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
MINIMAX_GROUP_ID="YOUR_GROUP_ID_HERE"
The application will automatically load these variables at runtime.
Step 4: Run the Local Development Server
With the virtual environment activated and the .env file configured, you can start the API:
code
Bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
--reload: Enables hot-reloading for development, automatically restarting the server when code changes are detected.
The API will now be running at http://localhost:8000.

### Step 5: Access the Interactive API Docs
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to the interactive Swagger UI documentation:
http://localhost:8000/docs
Here, you can explore all available endpoints, view their schemas, and test them directly from your browser.
üìñ API Usage Examples
All API endpoints are prefixed with /api/v1.
Health Check
Check if the service is running and all its internal components are initialized correctly.
Endpoint: GET /api/v1/health
curl Example:
code
Bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health"
Generate Speech (Using an existing voice)
Endpoint: POST /api/v1/tts/generate
Description: Generates speech from text using a pre-existing voice_id.
curl Example:
This command will send a request to generate speech and save the resulting audio as speech.mp3.
code
Bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tts/generate" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "text": "Hello world, this is a test of the API.",
  "voice_id": "male-english-2"
}' \
--output speech_from_existing_voice.mp3
Clone a Voice
Endpoint: POST /api/v1/voice/clone
Description: Uploads an audio file to create a new voice clone.
curl Example:
This command clones a voice from my_voice.mp3 and assigns it the ID MyClonedVoice01. A successful response will include the new voice_id.
code
Bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/clone" \
-F "new_voice_id=MyClonedVoice01" \
-F "audio_file=@/path/to/your/my_voice.mp3"
Clone and Generate Speech (Automated Workflow)
Endpoint: POST /api/v1/voice/clone-and-generate
Description: The primary automated endpoint. It clones a new voice from an audio file and immediately generates speech with it in a single call.
curl Example:
This command clones a voice from my_voice.mp3, names it MyWebAppVoice001, generates speech from the provided text, and saves the output to output.mp3.
code
Bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/voice/clone-and-generate" \
-F "text=This is a new voice, cloned and generated in one step." \
-F "new_voice_id=MyWebAppVoice001" \
-F "audio_file=@/path/to/your/sample.mp3" \
--output cloned_and_generated_speech.mp3
üìã API Endpoint Reference
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/v1/health	Checks the health of the API and its dependent services.
POST	/api/v1/tts/generate	Generates audio using a known voice_id and text.
POST	/api/v1/voice/clone	Creates a new voice clone from an uploaded audio file.
POST	/api/v1/voice/clone-and-generate	Handles the entire clone-and-speak workflow in a single API call.
üê≥ Docker Deployment
A multi-stage Dockerfile is provided for building a small, efficient production image.
1. Build the Docker Image
From the project's root directory, run:
code
Bash
docker build -t minimax-tts-api .
2. Run the Docker Container
You must provide the environment variables to the container. The easiest way is using the --env-file flag with your .env file.
code
Bash
docker run -d --rm \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --env-file .env \
  --name tts-api-container \
  minimax-tts-api
The containerized API is now running and accessible at http://localhost:8000.
-d: Run in detached mode.
--rm: Automatically remove the container when it stops.
-p 8000:8000: Map port 8000 on your host to port 8000 in the container.
--env-file .env: Load environment variables from the .env file.
--name tts-api-container: Assign a memorable name to the container.
‚òÅÔ∏è RunPod Deployment
This repository is compatible with RunPod Serverless. The runpod_app.py file serves as the entry point.
Create a New Template on RunPod.
Set the Container Image: Use the provided Dockerfile or point to a pre-built image in your container registry.
Define Secrets: Add your MINIMAX_API_KEY and MINIMAX_GROUP_ID as secure environment variables in the RunPod template settings.
Deploy your endpoint. The runpod_app.py handler will automatically load the secrets and initialize the service.
